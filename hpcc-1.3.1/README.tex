\section{Introduction}
This is a suite of benchmarks that measure performance of processor,
memory subsytem, and the interconnect. For details refer to the
HPC~Challenge web site (\texttt{http://icl.cs.utk.edu/hpcc/}.)

In essence, HPC~Challenge consists of a number of subbenchmarks each
of which tests a different aspect of the system.

If you are familiar with the High Performance Linpack~(HPL) benchmark
code (see the HPL web site:
\texttt{http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/}) then you can reuse the
build script file~(input for \texttt{make(1)} command) and the input
file that you already have for HPL. The HPC~Challenge benchmark
includes HPL and uses its build script and input files with only
slight modifications. The most important change must be done to the
line that sets the \texttt{TOPdir} variable. For HPC~Challenge, the
variable's value should always be \texttt{../../..} regardless of what
it was in the HPL build script file.

\section{Compiling}
The first step is to create a build script file that reflects
characteristics of your machine. This file is reused by all the
components of the HPC~Challenge suite. The build script file should be
created in the \texttt{hpl} directory. This directory contains
instructions (the files \texttt{README} and \texttt{INSTALL}) on how
to create the build script file for your system. The
\texttt{hpl/setup} directory contains many examples of build script
files. A recommended approach is to copy one of them to the
\texttt{hpl} directory and if it doesn't work then change it.

The build script file has a name that starts with \texttt{Make.}
prefix and usally ends with a suffix that identifies the target
system. For example, if the suffix chosen for the system is
\texttt{Unix}, the file should be named \texttt{Make.Unix}.

To build the benchmark executable (for the system named \texttt{Unix})
type: \texttt{make arch=Unix}.  This command should be run in the top
directory~(not in the \texttt{hpl} directory). It will look in the
\texttt{hpl} directory for the build script file and use it to build
the benchmark executable.

The runtime behavior of the HPC~Challenge source code may be
configured at compiled time by defining a few C preprocessor
symbols. They can be defined by adding appropriate options to
\texttt{CCNOOPT} and \texttt{CCFLAGS} make variables. The former
controls options for source code files that need to be compiled
without aggressive optimizations to ensure accurate generation of
system-specific parameters. The latter applies to the rest of the
files that need good compiler optimization for best performance. To
define a symbol \texttt{S}, the majority of compilers requires option
\texttt{-DS} to be used. Currently, the following options are
available in the HPC~Challenge source code:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{HPCC\_FFT\_235}: if this symbol is defined the FFTE
code (an FFT implementation) will use vector sizes and processor
counts that are not limited to powers of 2. Instead, the vector sizes
and processor counts to be used will be a product of powers of 2, 3,
and 5.
\item \texttt{HPCC\_FFTW\_ESTIMATE}: if this symbol is defined it will
affect the way external FFTW library is called~(it does not have any
effect if the FFTW library is not used). When defined, this symbol
will call the FFTW planning routine with \texttt{FFTW\_ESTIMATE}
flag~(instead of \texttt{FFTW\_MEASURE}). This might result with worse
performance results but shorter execution time of the
benchmark. Defining this symbol may also positively affect the memory
fragmentation caused by the FFTW's planning routine.
\item \texttt{HPCC\_MEMALLCTR}: if this symbol is defined a custom
memory allocator will be used to alleviate effects of memory
fragmentation and allow for larger data sets to be used which may
result in obtaining better performance.
\item \texttt{HPL\_USE\_GETPROCESSTIMES}: if this symbol is defined
then Windows-specific \texttt{GetProcessTimes()} function will be used
to measure the elapsed CPU time.
\item \texttt{RA\_SANDIA\_NOPT}: if this symbol is defined the
HPC~Challenge standard algorithm for Global RandomAccess will not be
used. Instead, instead an alternative implementation from Sandia
National Laboratory will be used.
\item \texttt{RA\_SANDIA\_OPT2}: if this symbol is defined the
HPC~Challenge standard algorithm for Global RandomAccess will not be
used. Instead, instead an alternative implementation from Sandia
National Laboratory will be used. This implementation is optimized for
number of processors being powers of two.
\item \texttt{USING\_FFTW}: if this symbol is defined the standard
HPC~Challenge FFT implemenation~(called FFTE) will not be used.
Instead, FFTW library will be called. Defining the
\texttt{USING\_FFTW} symbol is not sufficient: appropriate flags have
to be added in the make script so that FFTW headers files can be found
at compile time and the FFTW libraries at link time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Runtime Configuration}
The HPC~Challenge is driven by a short input file named
\texttt{hpccinf.txt} that is almost the same as the input file for
HPL~(customarily called \texttt{HPL.dat}). Refer to the directory
\texttt{hpl/www/tuning.html} for details about the input file for
HPL. A sample input file is included with the HPC~Challenge
distribution.

The differences between HPL's input file and HPC~Challenge's input
file can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lines 3 and 4 are ignored. The output is always appended to the
file named \texttt{hpccoutf.txt}.
\item There are additional lines~(starting with line 33) that may~(but
do not have to) be used to customize the HPC~Challenge benchmark. They
are described below.
\end{itemize}

The additional lines in the HPC~Challenge input file~(compared to the
HPL input file) are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lines 33 and 34 describe additional matrix sizes to be used for
running the PTRANS benchmark~(one of the components of the
HPC~Challenge benchmark).
\item Lines 35 and 36 describe additional blocking factors to be used
for running the PTRANS test.
\end{itemize}

Just for completeness, here is the list of lines of the HPC
Challenge's input file and brief description of their meaning:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line 1: ignored
\item Line 2: ignored
\item Line 3: ignored
\item Line 4: ignored

\item Line 11: numbers of process rows of each process grid for HPL (and PTRANS)
\item Line 12: numbers of process columns of each process grid for HPL (and PTRANS)
\item Line 13: threshold value not to be exceeded by scaled residual for HPL (and PTRANS)

\item Line 35: number of additional blocking factors for PTRANS
\item Line 36: additional blocking factors for PTRANS
\end{itemize}

\section{Running}
The exact way to run the HPC~Challenge benchmark depends on the MPI
implementation and system details.  An example command to run the
benchmark could like like this: \texttt{mpirun -np 4 hpcc}. The
meaning of the command's components is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{mpirun} is the command that starts execution of an MPI
code. Depending on the system, it might also be \texttt{aprun},
\texttt{mpiexec}, \texttt{mprun}, \texttt{poe}, or something
appropriate for your computer.

\item \texttt{-np 4} is the argument that specifies that 4 MPI
processes should be started. The number of MPI processes should be
large enough to accomodate all the process grids specified in the
\texttt{hpccinf.txt} file.

\item \texttt{hpcc} is the name of the HPC~Challenge executable to
run.
\end{itemize}

After the run, a file called \texttt{hpccoutf.txt} is created. It
contains results of the benchmark. This file should be uploaded
through the web form at the HPC~Challenge website.
